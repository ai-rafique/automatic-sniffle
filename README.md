# automatic-sniffle
This was a project for the DV2578 course where a proposed model of Voting Classifier was checked against 4 other classification models for the task of  binary text classification on sentiment analysis.


Project Folder contains code to run.

1.Machine_Learning_Project_.ipynb is the main file to work with.
It uses the imbd.csv file inside Data folder to work.

After a successful run, it should generate an excel file with time,accuracy and f1score data for
Gaussaian Naive bayes, Support vector machine, random forest, xgboost and proposed model (Voting 
linearSVC, DT, LogR)

2.poshoctest.ipynb relies on the 6.FINAL.xlsx file in Data folder. Replace it and give appropriate sheet
if needed but leave it as is for our project.

1000000.PCA_GridSearch_File.ipynb is a file added to show result of PCA and attempt at grid search. Not important
overall as other 2 files
